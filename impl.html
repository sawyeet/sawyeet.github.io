            <b>(a) Describe any hardware you used or built. Illustrate with pictures and diagrams.</b>

            There were 2 main hardware components. 
            <br>

            The first one is the Sawyer robot from the lab. This is a 7-DOF manipulator. 
            <br>

            The second one is the realsense camera. The camera has a max resolution of 720p at 15fps, and ___ at ___. The FOV is very small at ___ degrees.
            The last one is a piece of hardware that we built: The ball. The tennis ball that we tested worked well when held, but tracking failed when the ball was thrown relatively fast, and therefore the prediction failed too. So we ended up using a moderately filled balloon (to about 40% capacity), and wrapped with neon green duct tape. The tape not only improved segmentation and tracking, but also made the balloon heavier. This way it would follow a better projectile motion path rather than an unpredictable path. Because at the core, it was a balloon and had a larger surface area, we were able to throw it slowly, and this improved the tracking at “higher speeds”.

            <b>(b) What parts did you use to build your solution?</b>
            <br><br>

            <b>(c) Describe any software you wrote in detail. Illustrate with diagrams, flow charts, and/or other appropriate visuals. This includes launch files, URDFs, etc. 2 </b>
            <br><br>

            <b>(d) How does your complete system work? Describe each step. </b>
