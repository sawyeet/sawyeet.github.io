            Dhruv Swarup: I am a student in EECS (RES) and did my undergrad in ECE. I have worked on projects involving PCB design, programming of embedded systems like building a small lidar-based robot and am good at prototyping with sensors and actuators. I have also worked on software projects involving Python, C, and C++ (mainly on Linux). I have also dabbled in web development, both frontend, and backend.

            Dhruv Swarup: I wrote the code for tracking as well as the actuation. For the tracking I wrote a color segmentation script, along with contour detection, and centroid calculation. From there, I extracted the 3d coordinates of the point using the depth information from the realsense. I also wrote all of that in C++ using a Kalman filter, but due to some other issues, we decided to only use the Python code and implement a Kalman filter from scratch. In the IK code, I wrote a method of first subscribing to the predicted point, and then finding the closest hardcoded end-effector point, and looking up its IK solution. Then the code would command the Sawyer to move to that position. I also helped with the tuning of the Kalman filter parameters and debugging the code integration.
